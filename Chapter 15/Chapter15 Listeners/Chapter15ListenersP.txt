I'll primarly use the following graphical objects. Pane as a container for the ball, Circle,
to represent the ball, and buttons or KeyEvent for controlling the movement (up, down, left, and right).
I think I'll use keyboard keys for those, it would feel more intuitive.

In that case, I need to use KeyEvent listeners to detect arrow key presses.

To prevent the ball from moving out of sight, I can tell the program get the ball's position then check
the new position. If the new position is valid, move the ball; otherwise, do nothing.
