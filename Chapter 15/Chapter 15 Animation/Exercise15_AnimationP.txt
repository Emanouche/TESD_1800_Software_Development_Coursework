For graphical objects, I will need to make a pane to contain the pentagon and the moving rectangle.
A polygon to represent the pentagon, and a rectangle to be animated along the pentagon's outline.

I will use a mouse click listener to pause and resume the animation. I will use the left mouse button for the clicks.

To make it follow the outline, I can use PathTransition. I'll define a path using the pentagon's shape,
then use PathTransition to move the rectangle along this path.

To change the opacity of the rectangle, I can bind the rectangle's opacity to its position along the path.
I could use the TimeLine class to create a smooth transition that changes the opacity as the rectangle moves.
