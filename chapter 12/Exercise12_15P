(Write/read data) Write a program to create a file named Exercise12_15.txt if it does not exist. Write 100 integers created randomly into the file using text I/O. Integers are separated by spaces in the file. Read the data back from the file and display the data in increasing order.

How will you write to the file? How will you read from the file?

First I will need to import the Scanner utility as well as java.io.PrintWriter utility.
I can make an if condition that if the file already exist, for the program to exit and a message notifying the user that the file already exists. Then we'll use try to create an output file with a for loop to create 100 random integers. I wil also need to create an array list to keep track of the integers. Then I will need to display that data in increasing order. I can read from the file using System.out.print, but I need to figure out how. Probably by turning the list into string.
